### Sorry, but .. Who’s that? ?? 

- I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background of more than 10 years in different areas of Retail (sales, human resources, administration). 

- Originally from Argentina but living in Spain. 🌍
 
- I have a very restless, curious personality. I'm passionate about learning, and I love to keep growing with new challenges.

- After working in the Retail world in my country, I moved to Spain and found a new world. I’m am now convinced that this is what I am passionate about. In September 2020, I graduated as a **Full Stack Software Developer** 💥

- And now I'm ready for more. :rocket:
